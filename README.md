This project contains an intro to FlexBox layouts, primary showing the two fundamental concepts 
associated with Flex: A Flex container, and Flex items.

Simple div elements are used, but really could be any HTML elements.

Before Flex is used, you will see 10 colored boxes, each spanning the width of the page,
with a number centered.
